# Rocket-Elevators-Csharp-Controller
Hello! Here you will find Elevator Controller Project that can be used for Commercial type Buildings. In Current project we create a 4 elevator columns, that hold 5 elevators per column. Building has 60 floors and 6 basement floors. Each column responsible for certain range of floors. Depends on scenario, the proper elevator will be sent. 
The project folder has a test file with multiple scenarios to see how code works with different inputs. 
The Classes are separated in diferent files and named accordingly for convenience. 

As long as you have **.NET 6.0** installed on your computer, nothing more needs to be installed:

To launch the tests, make sure to be at the root of the repository and run:
`dotnet test`
You can also get more details about each test by adding the `-v n` flag:
